# Notes for [Quantum Explorers 2023](https://challenges.quantum.ibm.com/quantum-explorers-23)
The QE23 challenge is divided into seven badges.
- [Captain](#captain)
- [Space Combatant](#space-combatant)


## Captain
Introduction to Qiskit and Quantum Computing.

### Activities
- [Quantum Computing Demo Notebook](./Captain/QE_Introductory_Demo_2023.ipynb)


### Quiz Topics
- Basis states
- Quantum states and randomness
- Rotation
- Basic Qiskit syntax (QuantumCircuit, etc)
- Reading quantum circuit diagrams
- Reading/Construction of Qsphere
- manual construction of controlled gates
- Entanglement and measurement correlation
- Bell States
- GHZ States and their construction
- teleportation algorithm
- Grover's algorithm
  - implemetaion for the two qubit case
  - understanding effects of iterations on accuracy
- measurement in X and Y bases (instead of Z)
- annoyingly must read Quantum Kittens chapter 3 for context


## Space Combatant

### Quiz Topics
- Significant amount of normal Machine Learning vocabulary/concepts:
  - types of ML (supervised vs unsupervised vs re-inforcement learning)
  - general steps taken in each kind of ML
  - what is a generative model and what do you use it for
  - existing algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors, etc)
  - linear separability, activation functions, feature maps, confusion matrices, residuals
- RAM vs Quantum RAM
- data encoding techniques
- known the types of feature maps and neural network models provided in Qiskit's ML module
- types of simple circuits: parameterized, unparameterized, etc
- expressibility vs entanglement capability (from textbook)
- parity post processing for Quantum Classifier (from Amira's lecture)
- know the implementation of a quantum Vector Support Classifier
