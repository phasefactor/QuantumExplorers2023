# Notes for [Quantum Explorers 2023](https://challenges.quantum.ibm.com/quantum-explorers-23)
The QE23 challenge is divided into seven badges.
- [Captain](#captain)


## Captain
Introduction to Qiskit and Quantum Computing.

### Activities
- [Quantum Computing Demo Notebook](./Captain/QE_Introductory_Demo_2023.ipynb)


### Quiz Topics
- Basis states
- Quantum states and randomness
- Rotation
- Basic Qiskit syntax (QuantumCircuit, etc)
- Reading quantum circuit diagrams
- Reading/Construction of Qsphere
- manual construction of controlled gates
- Entanglement and measurement correlation
- Bell States
- GHZ States and their construction
- teleportation algorithm
- Grover's algorithm
  - implemetaion for the two qubit case
  - understanding effects of iterations on accuracy
- measurement in X and Y bases (instead of Z)
- annoyingly must read Quantum Kittens chapter 3 for context
